SANJURO
=======
"The spectator sees more than the player. He can judge the right course of action": Really resonantes with me on a poker level of how everyone at the table can tell a player is bluffing except the player he is bluffing.

Sanjuro: The most interesting Samurai in the world?
I don't always drink sake, but when I do it helps me think better.

Obvious plot twist: WE ARE MEETING WITH THE GUY RIGHT HERE TONIGHT!
Maybe not so obvious back in the 60s?

Oh shit, here they come. An AMBUSH!

Sanjuro saves them with the old, "hid them under the floorboards trick" (This is where George Lucas got it from!)

**While attempting to save Takako and Chidori (the Uncle Mutsuta's wife and daughter)**
"Are there fish in this pond?"
"Yes, big carp"
*Throws stone into pond*
*Bad guys come out*
"Must be a fish"
No further investigation.

Muroto just accused his three henchmen guards of Asian glow.

The two ladies, Takako and Chidori seem to be on drugs, they keep saying how lovely the hay smells.
Takako is totally freaking out Sanjuro.

New word I learned from Yojimbo and Sanjuro: Palanquins.

**While setting free the four young samurai who had followed Sanjuro when he attempt to go undercover**
"Can't you tell? I'm setting them free" *murders 15 people*

**Mutsuta's quote from someone who passed him while he was riding on a horse**
"'The rider has a longer face than the horse'" - Horseface.

That standoff duel at the end was pretty epic.
