Notes
=====
- I like the whole idea that Mifune's character (calling himself Kuwabatake Sanjuro) and the restaurant owner Gonji just opens up the windows to the restaurant, can see everything, and no one they're eavesdropping on cares.
- Almost certain Orin was the Medium from Rashomon but looked up on IMDB and found out she wasn't. Also found out she passed away over the summer. :(
- Tough to watch with fresh eyes. This plot is so familiar now with many movies adapting the style of this movie.
- There's a lot of continuity errors whenever there's a quick cut. Not exactly a dig against movies of this era, it's just how they were done. But nowadays most movies actually put a lot of effort into maintaining consistency between cuts.
- Guns are really expensive in this time, or at least rare. But it seems like Unosuke has an unlimited amount of ammunition for the pistol (until the very end of course). I mean in one scene he kinda brazenly fires a bullet off into the sky as though he doesn't care about it being wasted.
- "Hey I just killed all these guys and left their bodies lying around, see ya later"
