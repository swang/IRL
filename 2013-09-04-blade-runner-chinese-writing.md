![Hannibal Chew's freezer](https://raw.github.com/swang/IRL/master/images/outside-hannibal-chews-freezer.png)
Right before Batty/Leon enter Hannibal Chew's freezer (where he is working on eyes), on the wall outside of Hannibal Chew's freezer there is some chinese writing.

First section, top right says:
-------------------
出入平(安) / chu1ru4 ping2(an1): This phrase is missing the (安), put together this phrase means, 'peace wherever you go.' Funny enough, Google Translate converts this into (Access to safe)

Four characters bunched in a square on the bottom right
-------------------
親愛同胞 / qin1ai4 tong2bao1: "Dear Fellow Citizen"

Next
-------------------
國人好, 美國人不 / guo2ren2hao3, mei3guo2ren2bu4: "Countrymen welcome, Americans not"

So it seems to mean, Chinese people (Hannibal's fellow countrymen) are welcome, Americans are not...

Remaining Text

人在上行

得吃魚不要(?)
